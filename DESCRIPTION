Description: Mahalanobis-Taguchi (MT) system is a collection of multivariate
    analysis methods developed for the field of quality engineering. MT system
    consists of two families depending on their purpose. One is a family of
    Mahalanobis-Taguchi (MT) methods (in the broad sense) for diagnosis and the
    other is a family of Taguchi (T) methods for forecasting. The MT package
    contains three basic methods for the family of MT methods and one basic
    method for the family of T methods. The MT method (in the narrow sense), the
    Mahalanobis-Taguchi Adjoint (MTA) methods, and the Recognition-Taguchi (RT)
    method are for the MT method and the two-sided Taguchi (T1) method is for
    the family of T methods. In addition, the Ta and Tb methods, which are the
    improved versions of the T1 method, are included.
